                This is the official documentation for the UTA-GMS application. The application was written as part
                of <Text as={'b'}>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM BASED ON ROBUSTNESS
                ANALYSIS METHODS FOR PREFERENCE DISAGGREGATION</Text> bachelor thesis at the Pozna≈Ñ University of
                Technology in 2024 by Jakub Beisert, Filip Marciniak,
                Szymon Pasternak, Jakub ≈ªytli≈Ñski. The supervisor of the work was Mi≈Çosz Kadzi≈Ñski.
                The application allows users to model problems from the UTA family and then solve them using the UTA-GMS
                method.

                    As part of the robustness analysis, the system presents information about possible and necessary
                    relations between alternatives in the form of a matrix and Hasse graph,

                    The system informs the user about detected inconsistencies within the entered information
                    preference. It eliminates a minimum subset of inconsistent preferential information and
                    present all possible subsets of inconsistencies to the user,

                    As part of stochastic ordinal regression analysis, the system analyzes a set of functions
                    consistent with the decision-maker's preferences and present acceptability indices and pairwise
                    winning acceptability indices.
